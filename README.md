# CPP-Tasks

I transfer homework from [this repository](https://github.com/AngryRunt/AltTaskBook-homework) to CPP.
The assignments are based on a textbook from Alt linux in two parts. [Part one](https://wiki.altlinux.ru/Books:Python-sysoeva-ed2). [Part two](https://wiki.altlinux.ru/Books:Python-sysoeva-ed2-2).

## Work in a safe, isolated environment

To work in a secure environment, go to the container directory and build a container image using a script.
```shell
$ cd container
$ ./build-image.sh
```

After assembly, go to the directory above and run the script ```env.sh```
```shell
$ cd ..
$ ./env.sh
```
